## Hi there, I'm Fabian Gomez üëã

I'm a React.js Developer. I have had the opportunity to teach programming to over 120 students. My experience as a React.js developer and programming teacher has given me a deep appreciation for the intersection of technical skills, creativity, and design. I believe that these three elements are essential for creating truly great software, and I'm always excited to explore new ways to bring them together in my work.

## üëÄ About me

Before to my work as a developer, I was a co-founder of a company in the field of marketing and web design with WordPress. This experience provided me with a deep understanding of the importance of creativity and design in building successful websites and applications.

In addition to my technical skills, I also have a passion for teaching programming. I have had the opportunity to teach programming to over 120 students. I believe that teaching is a great way to solidify one's own understanding of a subject, and I take great joy in seeing my students grasp new concepts and develop their own programming skills.

In my projects, I enjoy exploring different design patterns and experimenting with new UI/UX concepts. Whether it's creating a slick new animation or implementing a new UI feature, I always strive to bring a touch of creativity and design to my work.
